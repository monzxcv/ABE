## Prerequisites
The schemes have been tested with Charm 0.50 and Python 3.7 on Ubuntu. Charm 0.5 can be installed by running 

``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Charm may not compile on Linux systems due to the incompatibility of OpenSSL versions 1.0 and 1.1. You can either install charm-crypto from the system package manager or downgrade OpenSSL to version 1.0.

Due to graduation thesis reasons, will temporarily remove part of the function of the source code.
