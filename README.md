# TDPUMCPABE
## Prerequisites
The schemes have been tested with Charm 0.50 and Python 3.7 on Ubuntu. Charm 0.5 can be installed by running 

``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Charm may not compile on Linux systems due to the incompatibility of OpenSSL versions 1.0 and 1.1. You can either install charm-crypto from the system package manager or downgrade OpenSSL to version 1.0.

## Status statement
Because one of the authors needs to transcribe the graduation thesis, at this stage, only the code of the scheme and the code for testing are released. The whole test system will be uploaded again after graduation thesis defense.
